Welcome ot BaseCamp. 

My objective here is self edjucational. I want to build and play with CMake 
and Jenkins. The idea is to have a repository which may be the setup of a 
large, complex, project which will necessitate building for various 
environments (use CMake) and initiate some kind of auto testing mechanism
(Jenkins). 

I used these tools but have never set something up from scratch. This will
address that whole in my experience.
